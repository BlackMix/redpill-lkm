## THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS
There's nothing to run/see here (yet ;)).

## What is this?
This is a major part of a tool which will be able to run a DSM instance for research purposes without
engaging your real DS machine and risking your data in the process (ask me how I know...).

## Target audience
This repository is target towards **developers** willing to learn and help with implementation of peculiarities of 
Synology's DSM Linux distribution.

Read about the quirk in a separate repo: https://github.com/RedPill-TTG/dsm-research/tree/master/quirks

## How to build?
1. You need Synology's GPL sources for the kernel. Check the [Makefile](Makefile) for details
2. `cd` to kernel sources
3. `cp synconfig/bromolow .config` (or any desired one)
4. `make oldconfig ; make modules_prepare`
5. `cd` back to the module directory
5. `make`
6. You will get a `redpill.ko` module as the result, you can `insmod` it

## Documentation split
The documentation regarding actual quirks/mechanisms/discoveries regarding DSM is present in a dedicated research repo 
at https://github.com/RedPill-TTG/dsm-research/. Documentation in this repository is solely aimed to explain 
implementation details of the kernel module. It will mostly be available in forms of long(ish) doc blocks.
